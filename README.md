a simple react and webpack spa with dev and prod configs

### Rename env file to .env

### Running prod version

The simplest way to serve your build is by using a static file server. You can use one of the following:

Install the `serve` package globally:

`npm install -g serve`
Run the server:

`serve -s dist`
This serves your static files on a default port (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
